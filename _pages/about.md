### Mis cursos de [Udemy](https://www.manuelcastillo.eu/udemy/){:target="_blank"}
Soy un entusiasta en la formación práctica de la Inteligencia Artificial, sobre todo en el área de Ciencia de Datos. De esta manera, he creado varios cursos de Inteligencia Artificial en castellano que puedes encontrar en Udemy. Todos ellos tienen un cupón de descuento en la [sección Udemy](https://www.manuelcastillo.eu/udemy/).

### Biography
Manuel Castillo Cara is a computer scientist and earned his PhD in Computer Science from the Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha (UCLM) in 2018 with the distinction of outstanding cum laude. From 2014 to 2020, he worked as a research professor in Peru, primarily at the Universidad Nacional de Ingeniería (UNI) and the Universidad de Lima (ULima). Between 2021 and 2023, he held a postdoctoral contract Recualificación - María Zambrano at the Universidad  Politécnica de Madrid (UPM) as part of a program to bring doctors back to Spain. Since 2023, he is working at the Universidad  Nacional de Educación a Distancia (UNED) as an Assistant Professor Doctor. He is currently accredited as an 'Associate professor’ by ANECA.

During his teaching period, he has participated in over 15 research projects, 2 of which he was the Principal Investigator.  He was also a team member in a social development project that aimed to develop technological skills for children in depressed areas of Peru. The project had over 2000 students between the ages of 8 and 15 in total. The courses covered topics such as educational robotics and programming with Scratch. Additionally, the teacher has received teaching awards for achieving the highest scores in academic surveys at UNI on four separate occasions.

His research interests are in Artificial Intelligence and computing architectures, specifically in sensor networks (WSN), distributed platforms and architectures like Fog Computing, data analysis/processing, pattern recognition and Computer Vision. He is the main developer of the [TINTOlib](https://github.com/oeg-upm/TINTOlib) library for developing Hybrid Neural Networks. He also implemented the method to convert tabular data into synthetic images, known as [TINTO](https://github.com/oeg-upm/TINTO). He has presented multiple seminars on AI and the use of [TINTOlib](https://github.com/oeg-upm/TINTOlib) in both Peru and Spain. Below are his general indicators of scientific production quality:
