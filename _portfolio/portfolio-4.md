## Abstract
Body-worn electronic device for tracking and tracing of persons or animals; with positioning and tracking sensors (GPS and Bluetooth/Wi-Fi), transmission or animals; with positioning and tracking sensors (GPS and Bluetooth/Wi-Fi), data transmission (GPRS) and energy data transmission (GPRS) and optimisation of energy and information (compass, altitude, temperature, gyroscope and accelerometer), gyroscope and accelerometer)

The following electronic device, which is attached to the body for tracking and tracing of people or animals, can be a bracelet, shackle or necklace. It is a hardware/software system that has the main objective to be able to track people both in Indoor and Outdoor for tracking and tracing. This device is built with different microcontrollers and sensors to be able to carry out this aspect. It has a GPS sensor for outdoor location, a Bluetooth/Wi-Fi sensor for indoor positioning, a GPRS module for mobile phone communication and compass, height, gyroscope and accelerometer sensors to optimise the energy consumed by the GPS module, i.e. outdoor positioning.
